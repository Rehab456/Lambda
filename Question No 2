#Question: Given a list of numbers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], first use the map function and a lambda function to double each number. Then, use the reduce function to find the product of the doubled numbers.

#Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#Expected Output: 122880 (Product of [4, 8, 12, 16, 20])

from functools import reduce
numbers =  [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
incresed_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x*2,numbers))
sum_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x *y, incresed_numbers)
print(incresed_numbers)
